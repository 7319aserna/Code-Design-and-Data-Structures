[Code Design and Data Structures](https://asgith.github.io/aie-code-design-and-data-structures-page) is a project created at the [Academy of Interactive Entertainment](https://seattle.aie.edu/campuses/seattle/). Coding is challenging, but rewarding. The purpose of this project was to understand how code can be improved/optimized, through the use of different types of containers, lists, to better help manage and organize code.

Latest Update:

* December 7th, 2018
  - Best lap logic has been implemented.
  - This logic will take the time from each lap, sort them into a list from least to greatest and display the fastest/smallest time.

  - A lap system has been built, there are three laps in total, and each lap the player has completed, will record and display the amount of time the player took to complete the lap.
